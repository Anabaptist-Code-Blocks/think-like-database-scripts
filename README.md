Sql scripts from my talk at codeblocks

The drop-non-primaryKey-index.sql file is helpful to drop non primary keys that you may have made. It first prints the ones to delete and if you are happy with that uncomment the execute line at the bottom and run again.

If you want to get the exact same database I was using the Small db from here: https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2015/10/how-to-download-the-stack-overflow-database-via-bittorrent/.
